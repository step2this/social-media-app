## Quick Start Guide

### For New Agent Sessions

**Step 1: Context Restoration** (2-3 minutes)
```bash
# Read the primary context document
cat /Users/shaperosteve/social-media-app/.context/project-context.md

# Check current state
git status
git log --oneline -10
pnpm servers:status
```

**Step 2: Find Your Scenario** (1 minute)
```bash
# Read the relevant section of the playbook
cat /Users/shaperosteve/social-media-app/.context/agent-playbook.md
# Search for your specific scenario
```

**Step 3: Execute** (varies)
```bash
# Follow the workflow from the playbook
# Update context documents as needed
```

## Context Maintenance

### When to Update Context Documents

**Update `project-context.md` when**:
- âœ… Major feature completed
- âœ… Architecture decision made
- âœ… New design pattern established
- âœ… Technical debt identified
- âœ… Significant blocker resolved
- âœ… Dependency or technology changed

**Update `agent-playbook.md` when**:
- âœ… New workflow discovered
- âœ… Better solution to common problem found
- âœ… New troubleshooting pattern identified
- âœ… Agent role pattern emerges
- âœ… Emergency recovery procedure changes

**Update both when**:
- âœ… Major project milestone reached
- âœ… Team conventions change
- âœ… Development process evolves

### How to Update

**Minor Updates** (quick fixes, clarifications):
```bash
# Edit directly
# Update "Last Updated" date
# No version bump needed
```

**Major Updates** (new sections, structural changes):
```bash
# Edit document
# Bump version number
# Update change log
# Add to git commit message
```

---

## Context Quality Standards

### Documentation Principles

1. **Clarity**: Write for someone with no prior context
2. **Completeness**: Include all essential information
3. **Currency**: Keep information up-to-date
4. **Conciseness**: Be thorough but not verbose
5. **Actionability**: Provide clear next steps
6. **Searchability**: Use consistent terminology
7. **Examples**: Include code examples where helpful

### Structure Requirements

- **Consistent Formatting**: Use markdown properly
- **Clear Headings**: Hierarchical and descriptive
- **Code Blocks**: Always include language tags
- **Lists**: Use bullets for items, numbers for sequences
- **Links**: Reference related sections and files
- **Metadata**: Maintain version info and dates

### Content Requirements

- **Context First**: Explain why before how
- **Assumptions Explicit**: State prerequisites clearly
- **Errors Documented**: Include common pitfalls
- **Success Criteria**: Define what "done" looks like
- **Trade-offs Noted**: Explain decision rationale

## Context Restoration Checklist

When starting a new session, complete this checklist:

### Environment Verification
- [ ] Read `project-context.md` thoroughly
- [ ] Review `agent-playbook.md` for relevant scenario
- [ ] Check git status and recent commits
- [ ] Verify server state: `pnpm servers:status`
- [ ] Review recent test results
- [ ] Check for uncommitted changes

### Orientation Questions
- [ ] What was the last completed feature?
- [ ] Are there any failing tests?
- [ ] Are there any known blockers?
- [ ] What is the next planned work?
- [ ] Are servers running properly?

### Preparation Steps
- [ ] Ensure clean server state
- [ ] Run baseline tests
- [ ] Review relevant code sections
- [ ] Create task plan
- [ ] Update context if needed

---

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Git Integration

**Context in Commits**:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature

Context: Continuing notification system work
Previous: Notification creation in handlers
This commit: Integration test verification

ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

**Context in Branches**:
- Branch names should reflect feature from context
- PR descriptions should link to context decisions

### Testing Integration

**Test Context**:
- Integration tests document expected behavior
- Test names should match context terminology
- Test results inform context updates

### Documentation Integration

**Cross-References**:
- CLAUDE.md provides development guidelines
- .context/ provides project state and history
- README.md provides project overview
- Code comments provide implementation details

---

## Advanced Context Patterns

### Context Versioning

**Version Format**: `MAJOR.MINOR`
- **MAJOR**: Significant structural changes, new sections
- **MINOR**: Updates to existing content, clarifications

**Example**:
- v1.0: Initial context document
- v1.1: Added troubleshooting section
- v2.0: Restructured with new architecture

### Context Compression

**When context grows too large**:
1. Archive historical sections to separate files
2. Create executive summaries
3. Use knowledge graph for relationships
4. Link to detailed documents

### Multi-Agent Coordination

**Context Handoff**:
```markdown
## Agent Handoff Log

### 2025-10-12 14:30 - Backend Agent -> Testing Agent
**Completed**: Notification handler implementation
**Status**: Code complete, needs verification
**Next Steps**: Run integration tests to verify
**Files Changed**:
- packages/backend/src/handlers/likes/like-post.ts
- packages/backend/src/handlers/comments/create-comment.ts
**Context**: See project-context.md Section 2.1
```
