# Phase 1: Environment Configuration Fix

## Problem Identified
- Express server (packages/backend/server.js) was loading environment variables from wrong path
- `config()` looked for .env in /packages/backend but file is in project root
- This caused TABLE_NAME to be undefined, preventing 3 profile handlers from loading

## Solution Applied
- Changed `config()` to `config({ path: '../../.env' })` in server.js
- Points dotenv to correct .env file in project root

## Results
**Before Fix:**
- ❌ `[dotenv] injecting env (0) from .env` - 0 variables loaded
- ❌ `🔑 Table: undefined`
- ❌ 3 profile handlers failed to load
- ❌ Only 9/12 handlers working

**After Fix:**
- ✅ `[dotenv] injecting env (15) from ../../.env` - 15 variables loaded
- ✅ `🔑 Table: tamafriends-local`
- ✅ `💾 DynamoDB: LocalStack`
- ✅ `📦 S3: LocalStack`
- ✅ All 12 handlers loaded successfully
- ✅ No environment variable errors

## File Changed
- `packages/backend/server.js` (line 13): Updated dotenv config path

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - All Lambda handlers now load successfully for LocalStack development
