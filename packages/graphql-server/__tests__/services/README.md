# Service Factory Test Suite

## TDD RED Phase Complete ‚úì

All 18 tests are failing as expected. Ready for GREEN phase implementation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run service factory tests
cd packages/graphql-server
pnpm test service-factory

# Expected output: 18 failed tests (RED phase)
# Test Files  1 failed (1)
# Tests       18 failed (18)
```

## Test Suite Overview

### Purpose
Comprehensive test coverage for Dependency Injection pattern that eliminates ~400 lines of duplicated service instantiation code across GraphQL resolvers.

### Test Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 18
- **Test File**: `service-factory.test.ts` (308 lines)
- **Implementation File**: `../src/services/factory.ts` (46 lines stub)
- **Test Categories**: 5 major categories
- **Current Status**: All failing (RED phase) ‚úì

## Test Categories

### 1. Service Factory Creation (6 tests)
Tests that verify the factory creates all required services with correct dependencies.

```typescript
‚úó should create all required services
‚úó should pass correct dependencies to ProfileService
‚úó should pass correct dependencies to PostService
‚úó should reuse ProfileService instance across dependent services
‚úó should create services with correct AWS configuration
‚úó should return Services interface with all required properties
```

**What's being tested:**
- All 5 services are created (Profile, Post, Like, Follow, Comment)
- Services receive correct constructor parameters
- ProfileService dependency is injected into PostService
- AWS configuration (S3, CloudFront) is passed correctly
- Return type matches Services interface

### 2. Context Integration (4 tests)
Tests that verify services integrate correctly with GraphQL context.

```typescript
‚úó should include services in GraphQL context
‚úó should allow services to be accessible via context.services
‚úó should use same dynamoClient as context
‚úó should use same tableName as context
```

**What's being tested:**
- Services object fits in GraphQL context structure
- Services accessible via `context.services.XXX` pattern
- Shared DynamoDB client across all services
- Shared table name across all services

### 3. Service Reusability (3 tests)
Tests that verify service instance management and isolation.

```typescript
‚úó should reuse same service instances across multiple resolver calls in same request
‚úó should create different service instances for different requests
‚úó should not leak service state between requests
```

**What's being tested:**
- Service instances reused within single request
- New service instances for each request
- No state leakage between requests (isolation)

### 4. Configuration (3 tests)
Tests that verify environment configuration is properly used.

```typescript
‚úó should use correct S3 bucket name from environment
‚úó should use correct CloudFront domain from environment
‚úó should use correct DynamoDB table name from context
```

**What's being tested:**
- Environment variables read correctly
- Configuration passed to services
- Context parameters override environment when needed

### 5. Error Handling (2 tests)
Tests that verify graceful handling of missing configuration.

```typescript
‚úó should handle missing S3 bucket name gracefully
‚úó should handle missing CloudFront domain gracefully
```

**What's being tested:**
- Missing environment variables don't crash
- Services still created with defaults
- Graceful degradation

## Architecture

### Current Problem
Resolvers duplicate service instantiation code ~20 times:

```typescript
// DUPLICATED IN EVERY RESOLVER - ~400 LINES TOTAL
const dynamoClient = context.dynamoClient;
const s3Client = createS3Client();
const s3BucketName = getS3BucketName();
const cloudFrontDomain = getCloudFrontDomain();

const profileService = new ProfileService(
  dynamoClient,
  context.tableName,
  s3BucketName,
  cloudFrontDomain,
  s3Client
);
const postService = new PostService(dynamoClient, context.tableName, profileService);
// ... more duplication
```

### Proposed Solution
Service factory creates services once in GraphQL context:

```typescript
// IN CONTEXT - ONCE PER REQUEST
export function createServices(
  dynamoClient: DynamoDBDocumentClient,
  tableName: string
): Services {
  // Create S3 client
  const s3Client = createS3Client();
  const s3BucketName = getS3BucketName();
  const cloudFrontDomain = getCloudFrontDomain();

  // Create ProfileService
  const profileService = new ProfileService(
    dynamoClient,
    tableName,
    s3BucketName,
    cloudFrontDomain,
    s3Client
  );

  // Create other services (dependency injection)
  const postService = new PostService(dynamoClient, tableName, profileService);
  const likeService = new LikeService(dynamoClient, tableName);
  const followService = new FollowService(dynamoClient, tableName);
  const commentService = new CommentService(dynamoClient, tableName);

  return {
    profileService,
    postService,
    likeService,
    followService,
    commentService,
  };
}

// IN RESOLVERS - CLEAN AND SIMPLE
const result = await context.services.postService.createPost({...});
```

### Service Dependencies

```
ProfileService (no dependencies)
  ‚Üì
PostService (depends on ProfileService)

LikeService (no dependencies)
FollowService (no dependencies)
CommentService (no dependencies)
```

## Test Execution

### Current Output (RED Phase)

```bash
$ pnpm test service-factory --run

 RUN  v1.6.1 /Users/shaperosteve/social-media-app/packages/graphql-server

 ‚ùØ __tests__/services/service-factory.test.ts  (18 tests | 18 failed) 5ms

 Test Files  1 failed (1)
      Tests  18 failed (18)
   Duration  178ms
```

All 18 tests failing with:
```
Error: createServices not implemented
```

### Expected Output (GREEN Phase - After Implementation)

```bash
 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  18 passed (18)
   Duration  ~200ms
```

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Implement Service Factory (GREEN)

- [ ] Implement `createServices()` function in `/src/services/factory.ts`
  - [ ] Create S3 client using aws-utils
  - [ ] Get S3 bucket name from environment
  - [ ] Get CloudFront domain from environment
  - [ ] Instantiate ProfileService with AWS config
  - [ ] Instantiate PostService with ProfileService dependency
  - [ ] Instantiate LikeService
  - [ ] Instantiate FollowService
  - [ ] Instantiate CommentService
  - [ ] Return Services object

### Phase 2: Update GraphQL Context

- [ ] Update `GraphQLContext` interface in `/src/context.ts`
  - [ ] Add `services: Services` property

- [ ] Update `createContext()` function
  - [ ] Call `createServices(dynamoClient, tableName)`
  - [ ] Add services to returned context
  - [ ] Remove old service instantiation code (currently creates profileService, postService, likeService for dataloaders)

### Phase 3: Update Resolvers

- [ ] Update `/src/schema/resolvers/Mutation.ts`
  - [ ] Replace service instantiation with `context.services.XXX`
  - [ ] Remove ~20 service instantiation blocks
  - [ ] Test all mutations work

- [ ] Update `/src/schema/resolvers/Query.ts`
  - [ ] Replace service instantiation with `context.services.XXX`
  - [ ] Remove service instantiation blocks
  - [ ] Test all queries work

- [ ] Update other resolver files as needed

### Phase 4: Verify Tests Pass (GREEN)

- [ ] Run `pnpm test service-factory` - should pass 18/18
- [ ] Run `pnpm test context` - update and verify
- [ ] Run `pnpm test` - all tests should pass
- [ ] Manually test GraphQL API

### Phase 5: Refactor (REFACTOR)

- [ ] Review code for improvements
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments
- [ ] Optimize imports
- [ ] Clean up any remaining duplication

## Benefits

### Code Quality
- **-400 lines**: Eliminates duplicated service instantiation code
- **DRY**: Single source of truth for service creation
- **SOLID**: Single Responsibility Principle (factory has one job)
- **Dependency Injection**: Clear service dependencies
- **Testability**: Easy to mock services in tests

### Performance
- **Fewer allocations**: Services created once per request
- **Shared instances**: ProfileService reused across dependent services
- **Reduced overhead**: No repeated AWS client creation in resolvers

### Developer Experience
- **Cleaner resolvers**: Focus on business logic, not infrastructure
- **Easy to extend**: Add new services in one place
- **Clear dependencies**: Explicit service relationships
- **Better IntelliSense**: Type-safe access to services
