# AuctionService Integration - Complete

## Summary

AuctionService has been successfully integrated into the GraphQL context following the existing service factory pattern.

## Changes Made

### 1. PostgreSQL Pool Singleton (`packages/auction-dal/src/utils/postgres.ts`)
- Created singleton pattern for PostgreSQL connection pool
- Configuration via environment variables
- Efficient connection reuse across application lifecycle
- Full test coverage (11 tests passing)

### 2. Auction DAL Exports (`packages/auction-dal/src/index.ts`)
- Exported `createPostgresPool` function
- Exported `AuctionService` class
- Follows monorepo dependency management principles

### 3. Service Factory Updates (`packages/graphql-server/src/services/factory.ts`)
- Added `AuctionService` to `Services` interface
- Created PostgreSQL pool using singleton pattern
- Instantiated `AuctionService` with pool
- Returned `auctionService` in services object

### 4. Test Updates (`packages/graphql-server/__tests__/services/service-factory.test.ts`)
- Added tests for `auctionService` creation
- Verified service is included in context
- Verified service instance creation
- All 20 tests passing

### 5. Package Dependencies (`packages/graphql-server/package.json`)
- Added `@social-media-app/auction-dal` as workspace dependency

Tests: 20 passed (20)
```

## Usage in Resolvers

AuctionService is now available in all GraphQL resolvers via the context:

```typescript
// Example resolver
export const auctionResolvers = {
  Query: {
    auction: async (_parent, { id }, context) => {
      // AuctionService is available via context.services.auctionService
      const auction = await context.services.auctionService.getAuction(id);
      return auction;
    },
    auctions: async (_parent, args, context) => {
      const result = await context.services.auctionService.listAuctions({
        status: args.status,
        limit: args.limit,
        cursor: args.cursor,
      });
      return result;
    },
  },
  Mutation: {
    createAuction: async (_parent, args, context) => {
      if (!context.userId) {
        throw new Error('Authentication required');
      }
      const auction = await context.services.auctionService.createAuction(
        context.userId,
        args.input,
        args.imageUrl
      );
      return auction;
    },
    placeBid: async (_parent, args, context) => {
      if (!context.userId) {
        throw new Error('Authentication required');
      }
      const result = await context.services.auctionService.placeBid(
        context.userId,
        args.input
      );
      return result;
    },
  },
};
```

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Consistent Dependency Injection
- Follows existing pattern used by ProfileService, PostService, etc.
- Single source of truth for service instantiation
- Proper service lifecycle management per request

### 2. Database Connection Management
- PostgreSQL pool singleton prevents connection leaks
- Efficient connection reuse across all requests
- Configurable pool settings (20 max connections, 30s idle timeout)

### 3. Type Safety
- Full TypeScript support through Services interface
- Context.services.auctionService is fully typed
- Compile-time verification of service availability

### 4. Testability
- Service factory can be easily mocked in tests
- Pool singleton can be reset for test isolation
- All services follow same testing patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Add GraphQL Schema**: Define auction types, queries, and mutations in `packages/graphql-server/src/schema/`
2. **Implement Resolvers**: Create resolver functions that use `context.services.auctionService`
3. **Add DataLoaders** (optional): If N+1 query problems occur, add DataLoader for batch loading
4. **Integration Tests**: Add end-to-end tests for auction workflows

## Environment Variables

Ensure PostgreSQL connection environment variables are set:

```bash
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost        # Default: 'localhost'
POSTGRES_PORT=5432            # Default: '5432'
POSTGRES_DB=auctions_dev      # Default: 'auctions_dev'
POSTGRES_USER=postgres        # Default: 'postgres'
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres    # Default: 'postgres'
```

## Files Modified

1. `/packages/auction-dal/src/utils/postgres.ts` (created)
2. `/packages/auction-dal/src/utils/postgres.test.ts` (created)
3. `/packages/auction-dal/src/index.ts` (updated)
4. `/packages/graphql-server/src/services/factory.ts` (updated)
5. `/packages/graphql-server/__tests__/services/service-factory.test.ts` (updated)
6. `/packages/graphql-server/package.json` (updated)

## Verification

To verify the integration:

```bash
# Run auction-dal tests
pnpm --filter @social-media-app/auction-dal test

# Run service factory tests
cd packages/graphql-server
pnpm exec vitest run __tests__/services/service-factory.test.ts
```

Both test suites should pass with all tests green.
